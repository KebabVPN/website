<p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”), along with the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> (the “Privacy Policy”), govern the use of and access to the different services offered by KebabVPN. (KebabVPN, “us”, “we” or “our”), our website (the “Site”), applications (including both the mobile and web versions) (the “Apps”), ChatBots, as well as all content (the “Content”) and software (the “Software”) associated with our services (collectively referred to as the “Services”).</p>
<p>By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy (together, the “Agreement”) constitute a legally binding agreement between you and KebabVPN, so please read them carefully.</p>


<h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
<p>By using and/or accessing the Services, you are agreeing on behalf of yourself or those you represent (“you”) to comply with and to be legally bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy in their entirety, including to be responsible for any charges arising from your use of the Services.</p>
<p>If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand the Agreement; and (iii) you agree and consent to the Agreement on behalf of the party that you represent.</p>
<p>By creating an account for using our Services, you represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age, or at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction where you reside or from which you use the Services, or that you are a valid legal entity, and that the registration information you have provided is accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Some sections of these Terms or the Privacy Policy may not apply to your specific use of the Services. Thus, if you do not agree with any part of the Agreement applicable to you, you may not use our Services.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Agreement governs your access to and use of the Services through any means or channels, including any access or use in connection with routers, VPN gateways, proxy servers  or other products offered by KebabVPN (the “Hardware”).</p>


<h2>2. Modification</h2>
<p>KebabVPN may update these Terms from time to time without notice. Unless it is otherwise stated by us, each update of the Terms comes into force as of the moment the amended Terms are published on the Site. If you continue to use the Services after these changes take effect, then you agree and consent to the revised Terms. The current version of the Terms is available on the Site. You understand and agree that it is your obligation to review these Terms from time to time in order to stay informed on current rules and obligations. Any core changes to the Terms will be delivered via one of communication channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>- email (to the email address you provide to us in case of web version usage)</li>
<li>- messengers bots</li>
<li>- banners or pop-up messages posted on the Site.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>KebabVPN is committed to your privacy and does not collect or log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, DNS queries, or user-linked IP addresses from Subscribers connected to our Services. During your registration, we may collect some personal information, such as your name, email address and payment information. We only collect such information as is strictly necessary for the proper delivery of the Services.</p>
<p>You can find detailed information related to data collection in the Privacy Policy. Please review the Privacy Policy in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your information, your rights, our rights, as well as our commitment to data protection.</p>

<h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Our Services are available to you upon registering an account (the “Account”) on the Site, the Apps or Chatbots. By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber (“Subscriber”) for the period you have elected or to buy a fixed usage period without subscription. A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available on the Site. KebabVPN reserves the right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the Site, on your Account, or sent via email or chatbot. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber’s current subscription period and will become effective upon subscription renewal. Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment companies. To find out more about these third-party payment companies and how they process your data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When supported by your payment method, plans renew automatically by default at the completion of the billing term. By default, the renewal term is for the same duration as the billing term for the original subscription. The subscription fee will be charged automatically to the payment method you last selected. If you would like to discontinue automatic renewal, you may do so via your Account or email us at support@kebabvpn.com. By default, auto-renewal is turned on when you use a payment method that supports auto-renewal (such as a credit card or PayPal), and turned off when you use a payment method that does not support auto-renewal (such as Bitcoin).</p>
<p>Each paid subscription grants you one (1) license to use our VPN Service on up to five (5) different devices at any given time. If you want to use the Services on more than five (5) devices at a time, then you can either (i) use VPNS on your router, (ii) purchase additional subscription plans, or (iii) purchase additional licenses through the “volume licensing” option. For more information on our “volume licensing” program, please contact Support at support@kebabvpn.com.</p>
<p>You understand that it is your responsibility to keep your Account information confidential and secure. You are solely responsible for all activity on your Account. If you ever discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your authorization, or that any of your passwords have been compromised (i.e., Account password or KebabVPN Keys primary password), you are advised to inform us immediately so that we can take appropriate action. Please refer to Section 5 for specific information about your KebabVPN Keys’ password and recovery code.</p>

<h2>5. Refund Policy</h2>
<p>You may cancel your Account for any reason within thirty (30) calendar days of your initial purchase and you will receive a full refund of the amount you paid (“Money Back Guarantee”) excluding actual time used. To cancel your account, please send a request to the following email address: support@kebabvpn.com</p>
<p>Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of KebabVPN, if a Subscriber can demonstrate that the Services were not available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact KebabVPN to resolve the issue. In this case, KebabVPN may provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata refund of Service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable.</p>
<p>Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days, and are made to the original form of payment used for purchase. All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency or Bitcoin (e.g., due to foreign exchange and processing charges linked to your method of payment). Refunds in crypto currencies are available using USDT.</p>
<p>Any change to the original purchase, such as upgrading to an extended billing term or purchasing of additional licenses under the same Account, shall constitute a waiver of the Money Back Guarantee option. To request a refund under the Money Back Guarantee, send an email with your request to the following email address: support@kebabvpn.com</p>
<p>Users whose subscriptions are billed as an in-app purchase through the Apple App Store (iTunes) do not have access to the KebabVPN 30-day Money Back Guarantee. Instead, users can request refunds through the Apple App Store, which are issued solely at the discretion of Apple Support.</p>
