<p>We want you to understand what information (including Personal Data) we collect in connection with your use of our Services and/or access to our Site; for what purpose such information is collected; how we collect, use, and store such information; to whom it may be disclosed; and how you can exercise your rights and access your information, verify its accuracy, correct and/or have it erased. Equally, we want you to know what information we do not collect under any circumstances.</p>
<p>In addition, this Privacy Policy outlines what security measures we take to safeguard your information and who you can contact if you have any queries or complaints about the contents of this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required to operate world-class Services at scale. We designed our systems (and strive to constantly improve them) to not store sensitive data about our customers. We cannot disclose, misuse, or abuse, even when compelled, data that we do not possess. We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction with the KebabVPN Terms of Service (the “Terms”). Together, they form a legally binding agreement between you and KebabVPN, so please read them carefully. Unless otherwise stated, the capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning given to them in the Terms.</p>
<p><b>KebabVPN core mission is to keep your information private.</b></p>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>KebabVPN may collect five (5) types of data depending on your use of the Services, as follows. You can find detailed information about each of them in the specific sections below. If you are just visiting our Site, please refer to Section 7.</p>
<p><b>(i) Personal data submitted in association with your Account (“Personal Data”)</b></p>
<p>Personal Data means any information that can be used, alone or combined with other data, to uniquely identify an individual. Personal Data is collected for the purpose of providing you with our Services and may include the name, email address, and payment information that you submit to us when you create or update your Account.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Aggregate Apps and VPN connection summary statistics (“Usage Statistics Data”)</b></p>
<p>A minimal amount of Usage Statistics Data is collected in order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service. This type of data does not include information about users’ browsing and internet activity, including while connected to the VPN—we do not collect (and therefore do not use, disclose, or store) data about the content or destinations of VPN traffic, DNS queries, or user IP addresses.</p>
<p><b>(iii) Anonymous App diagnostics, including crash reports (“App Diagnostic Data”) (optional)</b></p>
<p>App Diagnostic Data, which includes crash reports, usability diagnostics, and VPN connection diagnostics, is anonymized data that cannot be tied back to individual users. This feature is similar to a “send bug report” option. App Diagnostic Data is not shared by default. You must opt in, such as through the settings menu of your Apps, to send App Diagnostic Data to us.</p>
<h2>Personal Data</h2>
<p>KebabVPN collects Personal Data that you provide by creating or updating an Account. We require Personal Data, such as an email address and payment information, so that we can provide you with our Services, email you, collect payments, respond to support queries, and share relevant information about your Account and/or the Services.</p>
<p>Specific Personal Data collected will depend on the payment method you choose and may include information such as name, billing country, billing address, and/or credit card number. For some forms of payment, you may be redirected to external websites operated by third-party payment processors (e.g., PayPal, BitPay, Paymentwall, Stripe, or other specific payment processors, depending on your location) to complete the transaction. To understand what personal data these processors collect and store, please refer to the respective processor's terms and privacy policy. Payment methods that help to minimize the amount of Personal Data you submit to us, such as Bitcoin, are also available for you to use to subscribe to our Services.</p>
<p>KebabVPN uses your email address for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide you with access to our Services, including through password reset emails.</li>
<li>To send emails related to your payment transactions.</li>
<li>To send you updates and announcements.</li>
<li>To communicate with you about your Account or respond to your communications.</li>
<li>To send marketing information, such as offers, surveys, invitations, and content about other matters in connection with KebabVPN that we believe may be of interest to you (“Marketing Emails”). You may choose to not receive Marketing Emails by following the unsubscribe procedure described in these emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>KebabVPN uses your Personal Data only for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, and we do not sell or lease your Personal Data to third parties. We collect and process your Personal Data for legitimate interest under the applicable law, more specifically to fulfill our contractual obligations to you (i.e., according to the Agreement between you and KebabVPN).</p>
<p>Any personal information associated with KebabVPN accounts is controlled only by KebabVPN, including being stored on systems and servers owned or leased by KebabVPN and its subsidiaries. In the limited circumstances where this data may need to be processed by other related entities, it may be shared only when required, and for the duration required, for processing solely related to the purposes and legitimate interests outlined in this Privacy Policy, while ensuring at all times the same data protection standards. For avoidance of doubt, these circumstances do not include any situations where control of personal information of KebabVPN users will be transferred to any other related entities, for any duration of time.</p>

<h3>How We Protect and Retain Your Personal Data Security</h3>
<p>We have implemented best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security measures with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your Personal Data. Although we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data security measures in the world can offer completely infallible protection. For this reason, our guiding principle is to collect minimal data.</p>
<p>Servers and data centers. Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices. None of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or Personal Data related to your use of the Services. If any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said service provider and find alternative options. Even if a government were to physically seize one of our VPN servers, there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular event, website, or behavior.</p>

<h3>Retention of your Personal Data.</h3>
<p>Your Personal Data—which, to reiterate, never includes any sensitive data such as browsing history, DNS queries, or user-linked IP addresses—is retained for a limited period in accordance with applicable data protection law (for as long as we have your consent or a legitimate reason for holding such data). You may request to have your data deleted by sending a valid deletion request (please see Section 11). Please note that if you request the deletion of your Personal Data, you will as a result no longer be able to use the Services.</p>

<p>How We Safeguard Your Personal Data With Relation to Service Providers</p>
<p>Agents, contractors, and third-party service providers of KebabVPN (“Service Providers”) may have controlled access to relevant data to help us process payments, administer the Services, and otherwise assist us in operating our business. All Service Providers who may gain access to such data have confidentiality and data processing obligations to keep the data confidential and not use them for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing on behalf of KebabVPN. These obligations include contractual commitments to protect data as required by applicable laws, including those covering the transfer of Personal Data from the European Union / European Economic Area to a third country.</p>

<p>Service Providers only have access to the data necessary for the services they are performing on behalf of KebabVPN, which in any case will never include VPN activity or connection data as we do not collect such data. </p>

<p>In addition to Service Providers, we may share your Personal Data where you have provided your consent to us for sharing or transferring your Personal Data (e.g., marketing consents or opt-in to optional additional services or functionality).</p>

<h2>Usage Statistics Data and App Diagnostic Data</h2>
<p>In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, KebabVPN collects certain information related to your VPN usage, as described below. This data is visible to our staff strictly on a need-to-know basis, and may be shared with Service Providers for the purposes above, but are kept confidential at all times.</p>
<p>We ensure that Usage Statistics Data and App Diagnostic Data never include any sensitive information, in line with our overall commitment to never logging browsing history, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries.</p>

<p>Our principle of minimal data collection means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.</li>
<li>We do not know which user was connected to the VPN at a specific time or which VPN server IP addresses they used.</li>
<li>We do not know the set of original IP addresses of any given user’s computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should anyone try to compel KebabVPN to release user information based on any of the above, we cannot supply this information because the data does not exist.</p>

<h3>Apps and Apps versions</h3>
<p>We collect information related to which Apps and Apps version(s) you have activated in order to use our Services. Knowing your current version of the Apps allows our Support Team to troubleshoot technical issues you may encounter.</p>

<h3>Successful connection</h3>
<p>We collect information about whether you have successfully established a VPN connection on a particular day (but not a specific time of the day), to which VPN location (but not your assigned outgoing IP address), and from which country/ISP (but not your source IP address). This minimal information assists us in providing technical support, such as identifying connection problems, providing country-specific advice about how to best use our Services, and enabling KebabVPN engineers to identify and fix network issues.</p>

<h3>Aggregate sum of data transferred (in MB)</h3>
<p>We collect information regarding the total sum of data transferred by a given user. Although we provide unlimited data transfer, if we notice that a single user pushes more traffic than thousands of others combined, thereby affecting the quality of Services for other KebabVPN users, we may contact that user for an explanation.</p>

<h3>Usage Statistics Data summary</h3>
<p>In summary, we collect minimal usage statistics to maintain our quality of service. We may know, for example, that our customer John had connected to our New York VPN location on Tuesday and transferred an aggregate of 823 MB of data across a 24-hour period. John can’t be uniquely identified as responsible for any specific online behavior because his usage pattern overlaps with thousands of other KebabVPN customers who also connected to the same location on the same day.</p>

<p>We’ve engineered our systems to categorically eliminate storage of sensitive data. We may know THAT a user has used KebabVPN, but we are unable to single out the user and we never know HOW they have utilized our Service. We stand by our firm commitment to our users’ privacy by not possessing any data related to a user’s online activities.</p>

<h3>How We Protect and Retain Information Related to Email, Live Chat, and Feedback Forms</h3>
<p>KebabVPN keeps records of any correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit to us through our Site or Services, along with our response. Depending on how you contact KebabVPN, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us. Having full correspondence records enables our staff to provide the best possible customer support experience.</p>

<p>For user experience and analytics purposes, KebabVPN uses several analytics services, including from third-party Service Providers. These services may use cookies, mobile identifiers, and other data to generate reports and statistics, but have no access to information that directly identifies individuals nor any Personal Data that users provide to KebabVPN.</p>
